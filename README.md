**Project Overview**
This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients using machine learning algorithms.
The dataset used in this project contains various medical attributes such as glucose level, BMI, age, and more.
The goal is to create a predictive model that can help healthcare professionals make informed decisions.

**Dataset** 


The dataset used for this project is provided in the file diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv and download this file from Kaggle. It contains the following columns:

	•	Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
	•	Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration
	•	BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
	•	SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
	•	Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
	•	BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
	•	DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A function that represents the likelihood of diabetes based on family history
	•	Age: Age in years
	•	Outcome: Class variable (0: Non-diabetic, 1: Diabetic)

**Features**

	•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the dataset and its correlations.
	•	Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, feature scaling, and dataset splitting.
	•	Model Building: Train various machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.) to predict diabetes.
	•	Evaluation Metrics: Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the models.
